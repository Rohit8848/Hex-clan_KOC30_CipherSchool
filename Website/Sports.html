    <h2><u>Football</u></h2>
    <img src="wp9118841-4k-football-desktop-wallpapers.jpg"><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <p>A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football. 
        Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a Dream Team or Team of the Century) and never play an actual match. 
        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. 
        Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. 
        The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. 
        By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. 
        During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

    <h2><u>Badminton</u></h2>
    <img src="shuttlecocks-badminton-racket-two-31668779.jpg"><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
        Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). 
        Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. 
        Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. 
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. 
        Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side. 
        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. 
        In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly, Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. 
        The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature. The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. 
        European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. 
        Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added four years later. 
        At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. 
        It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

    <h2><u>Swimming</u></h2>
    <img src="download.jfif"><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <p>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. 
        The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports,with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.
        In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. 
        A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle
        Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke.
        There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.
        Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.</p>
