            <h2>--------- Why "ALL STARS SPORTS" Club??? ---------</h2>
            <p1>
                Sports clubs range from organisations whose members play together, unpaid, and may play other similar clubs on occasion, watched mostly by family and friends, to large commercial organisations with professional players which have teams that regularly compete against those of other clubs and attract sometimes very large crowds of paying spectators.<br/>
                 Clubs may be dedicated to a single sport or to several (multi-sport clubs).<br/>
                The term athletics club is sometimes used for a general sports club, rather than one dedicated to athletics proper.<br/>
